        <p class="heading-color">Your generous contribution will support keeping this webpage on the web. Domains for webpages cost me money however with domains I can add a ton of features to RFG, most of which deals with communication between the users of this page and the page creator(me).</p>
        <p class="heading-color">Every dollar you donate will not only fund the domain but also for every dollar I will add 1 random fact, you can even suggest it if you wish through the links provided on the website. Right now with no domain communication is very rough and not very personal as the only free communication is via google forms.</p>
        <p class="heading-color"> If I ever get enough funding I will be able to get web hosting which allows for POST request(a better alternative to google forms).</p>
